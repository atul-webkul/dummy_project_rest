Bid management dashboard.  Create bids, submit bids for quote responses, and manage them through various stages.

== Description ==

The WP Bid Manager allows users to create and manage bids.  Past or present, accepted or not, bid management is completely at your finger tips.  Enjoy the power of sending emails to whoever you would like in order to provide them with your bid details so they can give you a quote on your bid.  In addition, you can use the power of Google’s Maps to track your current bids locations.  This handy visual aid is available using an API key that is free to obtain from Google.
